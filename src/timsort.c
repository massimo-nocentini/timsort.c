       data movement). This is significant in cases like sortperf.py's %sort,
       where an out-of-order element near the start of a run is moved into
       place slowly but then the remaining elements up to length minrun are
       generally at worst one slot away from their correct position (so only
       need 1 or 2 commpares to resolve). If comparisons are very fast (such
       as for a list of Python floats), the simple inner loop leaves it
       very competitive with binary insertion, despite that it does
       significantly more compares overall on random data.

       Binary insertion sort has worst, average, and best case O(n log n)
       cost for # of comparisons, but worst and average case O(n**2) cost
       for data movement. The more expensive comparisons, the more important
       the comparison advantage. But its branches are less predictable the
       more "randomish" the data, and that's so significant its worst case
       in real life is random input rather than reverse-ordered (which does
       about twice the data movement than random input does).

       Note that the number of bytes moved doesn't seem to matter. MAX_MINRUN
       of 64 is so small that the key and value pointers all fit in a corner
       of L1 cache, and moving things around in that is very fast. */

Sort the list in ascending order and return None.

The sort is in-place (i.e. the list itself is modified) and stable (i.e. the
order of two equal elements is maintained).

If a key function is given, apply it once to each list item and sort them,
ascending or descending, according to their function values.

The reverse flag can be set to sort in descending order.
